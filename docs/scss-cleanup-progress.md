## Summary

The SCSS optimization is progressing well with Phase 1 completed and Phase 2 at 75% completion. We have successfully cleaned up 5/7 SCSS files, with 2 files fully removed (`_buttons.scss` and `_cards.scss`) and 3 files partially cleaned up (`_dashboard.scss`, `_forms.scss`, and `_alerts.scss`).

A significant milestone has been achieved with the development of the Toast notification system, which is now fully implemented with Tailwind CSS. The Toast component includes:

- Direct component usage through `<Toast>` component
- Application-wide plugin through `useToast()` composable
- Support for all notification types (success, error, warning, info)
- Action buttons functionality
- Position customization
- Duration settings

The next focus will be on creating Tailwind components for remaining form elements, particularly checkboxes and radio buttons, and beginning work on the navigation components. The project is on track to meet the optimization goals, with an overall progress of 70%.
