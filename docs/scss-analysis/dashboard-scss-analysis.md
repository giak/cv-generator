2. **Sidebar** - Collapsible navigation sidebar with responsive behavior
3. **Sidebar header** - Logo and brand name section

## Migrated Component Check

The following components have been implemented using Tailwind:

- `DashboardLayout.vue` - Main dashboard layout container with responsive behavior
- `NavMenu.vue` - Navigation menu with items and groups
- `BreadcrumbNav.vue` - Breadcrumb navigation for dashboard header
- `UserInfo.vue` - User information display in sidebar footer
- `SearchInput.vue` - Search input field for dashboard header
- `PageHeader.vue` - Page header with title and description for content areas

## Usage Analysis

A review of the App.vue file shows:

- Migration to use the new Tailwind-styled components is in progress
- The layout components have been imported and are being utilized
- Some transitional classes may still be in use

## Decision

⚠️ **Partial Cleanup Required**

The `_dashboard.scss` file cannot be completely removed yet, but substantial portions can be cleaned up:

1. Sections fully migrated to components can be removed
2. Global layout styles that might still be referenced should be kept temporarily
3. A clear comment should be added indicating the transitional state

## Cleanup Steps

1. Update the file to remove migrated sections:

   - Remove `.dashboard-sidebar` styles (migrated to `DashboardLayout.vue`)
   - Remove `.nav-menu` styles (migrated to `NavMenu.vue`)
   - Remove `.breadcrumb` styles (migrated to `BreadcrumbNav.vue`)
   - Remove `.user-info` styles (migrated to `UserInfo.vue`)
   - Remove `.search-input` styles (migrated to `SearchInput.vue`)
   - Remove `.page-header` styles (migrated to `PageHeader.vue`)

2. Add migration status comment at the top of the file:

   ```scss
   /**
    * MIGRATION STATUS: Partial - In Progress
    * 
    * This file is being progressively migrated to Tailwind components.
    * The following sections have been fully migrated and can be removed:
    * - Sidebar (→ DashboardLayout.vue)
    * - Navigation menu (→ NavMenu.vue)
    * - Breadcrumbs (→ BreadcrumbNav.vue)
    * - User info (→ UserInfo.vue)
    * - Search input (→ SearchInput.vue)
    * - Page header (→ PageHeader.vue)
    * 
    * Remaining sections need verification before removal.
    */
   ```

3. Keep basic dashboard container styles and any global layout utilities that might still be in use

## Post-Cleanup Verification

After partial cleanup:

1. Build the application to ensure no build errors
2. Test the dashboard layout in various viewport sizes
3. Verify sidebar responsiveness and collapsing behavior
4. Test navigation, breadcrumbs, and page headers
5. Check for any styling regressions

## Next Steps for Complete Removal

1. Verify that all App.vue references use the new components exclusively
2. Check for any lingering references to dashboard SCSS classes
3. Complete the full migration of any remaining global layout styles
4. Once verified, completely remove the file and update imports
