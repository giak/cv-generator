# Tailwind CSS Migration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines our approach to migrating the CV Generator application to use Tailwind CSS exclusively. We're following a component-by-component migration approach to ensure a smooth transition while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Migration Principles

1. **Replace custom classes with Tailwind utilities**

   - Convert all custom CSS classes to equivalent Tailwind utilities
   - Maintain the same visual appearance and behavior
   - Preserve responsive design patterns

2. **Eliminate custom CSS**

   - Remove all scoped CSS in component files
   - Remove global CSS classes that duplicate Tailwind functionality
   - Use Tailwind's configuration for customizations when needed

3. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**

   - Ensure all tests continue to pass
   - Preserve existing DOM structure for stable selectors
   - Maintain all accessibility attributes

4. **Follow Best Practices**
   - Use dynamic class binding for conditional states
   - Extract complex class combinations into computed properties
   - Use Tailwind's group-_ and peer-_ modifiers for relational styling

## Reference Library Components

The following components have been migrated to serve as reference implementations:

## SCSS Optimization Progress

| SCSS File           | Status            | Notes                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `_buttons.scss`     | Ready for removal | All components migrated (100%)      |
| `_cards.scss`       | Ready for removal | All components migrated (100%)      |
| `_dashboard.scss`   | Partial cleanup   | Most components migrated (95%)      |
| `_forms.scss`       | Partial cleanup   | Components partially migrated (73%) |
| `_alerts.scss`      | Partial cleanup   | Components partially migrated (58%) |
| `_navigation.scss`  | Pending           | Not started yet                     |
| `_data-panels.scss` | Pending           | Not started yet                     |

### Cleanup Scripts

We have created several scripts to assist with the SCSS optimization process:

1. **Full Removal Script** - `scripts/clean-scss.sh` âœ…

   - Removes fully migrated SCSS files (`_buttons.scss` and `_cards.scss`)
   - Updates imports in `main.scss`
   - Creates backups before removal

2. **Dashboard Layout Cleanup Script** - `scripts/partial-scss-cleanup.sh` âœ…
   - Updates partially migrated SCSS files (`_dashboard.scss`)
   - Adds migration status comments
   - Removes migrated sections while retaining necessary styles
   - Creates backups before modification
3. **Forms Cleanup Script** - `scripts/forms-scss-cleanup.sh` âœ…

   - Partially cleans up `_forms.scss` (73% migrated)
   - Adds migration status comments
   - Removes migrated sections while retaining necessary styles
   - Creates backups before modification

4. **Alerts Cleanup Script** - `scripts/alerts-scss-cleanup.sh` ðŸ†•
   - Partially cleans up `_alerts.scss` (58% migrated)
   - Adds migration status comments
   - Removes migrated sections (alert container and variants)
   - Retains toast notification styles that still need migration
   - Creates backups before modification

The next focus will be on migrating the remaining form control components and cleaning up `_alerts.scss`.

### Benefits of SCSS Optimization

1. **Reduced Bundle Size** - Eliminates duplicate styles between SCSS and Tailwind
2. **Simplified Maintenance** - Single source of styling truth
3. **Improved Developer Experience** - Consistent styling approach
4. **Better Performance** - Fewer CSS rules to process

## Benefits Realized

- **Reduced CSS bundle size** - Eliminating custom CSS in favor of utility classes
- **Improved consistency** - Using standard Tailwind patterns for common UI elements
- **Better maintainability** - Components are self-contained with all styling defined inline
- **Enhanced developer experience** - More intuitive styling approach with predictable results
- **Future-proof** - Ready for Tailwind CSS v4 upgrades

## Next Steps

1. Continue methodically migrating components by module:

   - Shared components
   - Form components
   - Layout components
   - Module-specific components

2. Refactor global styles:

   - Remove redundant CSS
   - Migrate necessary global styles to Tailwind config
   - Update CSS reset strategies

3. Create automated test workflow:
   - Visual regression tests
   - Style lint checks for Tailwind usage
   - Accessibility validation
