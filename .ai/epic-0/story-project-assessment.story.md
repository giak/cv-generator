# Epic-0: Project Maintenance and Optimization

# Story-1: Project Assessment and Improvement Plan

## Story Description

**As a** project manager  
**I want** a comprehensive assessment of the current project state and a detailed improvement plan  
**so that** we can prioritize tasks, address technical debt, and optimize the application for future development

## Status

In Progress

## Context

We have successfully implemented the core functionality of the CV Generator application in Epic-1, including project setup, domain models, form implementation, data management, and validation strategy. The application follows Clean Architecture and DDD principles with a monorepo structure.

This story aims to:

1. Evaluate the current state of the project
2. Identify areas for improvement and refactoring
3. Create a detailed plan for dependency updates and optimizations
4. Outline the next steps for feature implementation

This assessment is critical as we move from Epic-1 (Core CV Management) to Epic-2 (Sections Avancées) and prepare for future epics. It will help ensure that we maintain high code quality, follow best practices, and build on a solid foundation.

### Technical Context

- Vue 3.4+ with TypeScript 5.7+
- Monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
- Clean Architecture and DDD implementation
- Tailwind CSS 3 for styling
- Validation with Zod
- State management with Pinia
- Testing with Vitest

### Business Drivers

- Ensure maintainable and scalable codebase as features expand
- Improve developer experience and productivity
- Prepare for advanced features in upcoming epics
- Address technical debt early to prevent accumulation
- Optimize performance for better user experience

## Dev Notes

### Key Improvements Needed

#### 1. Style Harmonization

- Current mixed usage of direct SCSS and Tailwind classes
- Need to standardize approach following @2001-tailwind-vue3.mdc guidelines
- Plan to migrate custom SCSS to Tailwind utility classes where possible
- Inconsistent color variable usage between SCSS and Tailwind
- Multiple approaches to responsive design (some using Tailwind breakpoints, others using custom media queries)

#### 2. Component Architecture

- Some components have grown too large and need decomposition
- Form components should follow more consistent patterns
- Need better separation between presentational and container components
- Inconsistent prop and event naming conventions
- Lack of proper TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Overuse of deeply nested component hierarchies causing prop drilling issues

#### 3. Testing Strategy

- Current test coverage is incomplete, especially for UI components
- Need to strictly follow TDD workflow according to @003-tdd-workflow.mdc
- Increase test coverage for edge cases and error scenarios
- Lack of integration tests between components
- Missing performance and accessibility tests
- Inconsistent test structure and assertion patterns

#### 4. Font Management

- Current usage of Google Fonts causes performance issues
- Plan to migrate to local fonts for better performance and privacy
- Need to implement proper font fallbacks
- Inconsistent typography scale usage across components
- Font loading strategy causes Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) issues

#### 5. State Management

- Some Pinia stores have grown complex and need refactoring
- Improve separation between UI state and domain state
- Add better type safety to store actions and getters
- Lack of consistent error handling in asynchronous actions
- Insufficient hydration strategy for persisted state
- Overlapping responsibilities between stores

#### 6. Build Performance

- Slow development build times affecting developer experience
- Large bundle size due to unoptimized dependencies
- Inefficient code splitting configuration
- Missing module federation for shared components
- No strategy for Web Workers to offload heavy computations

#### 7. API Integration

- Inconsistent error handling patterns across API calls
- Lack of request caching strategy
- Missing retry mechanisms for network failures
- No offline support or synchronization strategy
- Insufficient request cancellation on component unmount

#### 8. Accessibility

- Inconsistent ARIA attributes usage
- Keyboard navigation issues in complex components
- Missing focus management in modals and dialogs
- Color contrast issues in some UI elements
- Lack of proper screen reader announcements for dynamic content

#### 9. Internationalization

- Hardcoded strings throughout the codebase
- No structured approach to message extraction
- Missing pluralization and date formatting utilities
- Lack of RTL layout support
- No strategy for locale-specific validation rules

#### 10. Documentation

- Outdated architecture documentation
- Missing component API documentation
- Inconsistent code comments quality
- Lack of usage examples for complex components
- No developer onboarding guide

## Next Actions (Prioritized)

1. Complete dependencies audit and update plan
2. Standardize component architecture for form fields
3. Implement reusable array field component for work and education sections
4. Migrate custom SCSS to Tailwind utility classes
5. Improve test coverage for core components and validation logic

These actions will establish a solid foundation for implementing Epic-2 features while ensuring maintainability and scalability of the codebase.
