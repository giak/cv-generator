## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Fundamental Architecture

- **Architectural Pattern**: Simplified Clean Architecture, PNPM monorepo with package structure
- **Functional Breakdown**:

  - **@cv-generator/core**: Domain entities (Resume, Work, Education, etc.) and use cases based on the JSON Resume standard
  - **@cv-generator/ui**: User interface components, pages and stores (presentation)
  - **@cv-generator/infrastructure**: Concrete implementations for localStorage and exports
  - **@cv-generator/shared**: Shared types and utilities, including Zod validation schemas for the JSON Resume format

- **Monorepo Organization**:

  ```
  cv-generator/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Business logic, entities and use cases
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ i18n/  # Internationalization port for the domain
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/ # Concrete implementations (localStorage, exports)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/         # Types, constants and shared utilities
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constants/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ error-codes.const.ts  # Existing error codes
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ i18n/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ keys/  # Centralized translation keys
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/             # Vue.js user interface
  ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
  ‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ i18n/   # Vue I18n configuration and adapters
  ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ locales/  # Translation files by language
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pnpm-workspace.yaml # Workspace configuration
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json        # Root scripts and dependencies
  ```

- **Internationalization Architecture**:

  Internationalization follows Clean Architecture principles:

  1. **@cv-generator/shared**: Contains centralized translation keys
  2. **@cv-generator/core**: Defines an agnostic internationalization port
  3. **@cv-generator/ui**: Implements a Vue I18n adapter that connects the UI to the core

  This approach allows the domain to remain isolated while benefiting from i18n features.

- **Main Data Flows**:

  1. **CV Creation/Editing**:

     - User interacts with UI forms (@cv-generator/ui)
     - Vue.js composables call use cases (@cv-generator/core)
     - Domain entities validate and encapsulate logic according to the JSON Resume standard
     - Data is persisted in localStorage via repository (@cv-generator/infrastructure)

  2. **CV Export**:

     - User requests an export (JSON, HTML or PDF)
     - Application prepares and formats the data according to the format
     - For JSON export, the application checks compliance with the JSON Resume standard
     - The file is generated and offered for download (@cv-generator/infrastructure)

  3. **ATS Optimization**:

     - Application analyzes the CV content
     - Real-time optimization tips are displayed
     - An ATS readability score is calculated

  4. **Internationalization**:
     - UI texts use the Vue I18n plugin via `$t('key')`
     - Domain error messages use keys defined in shared
     - An adapter passes translations from the UI to the domain via the internationalization port

- **External Integration Points**:
  - Ability to import CVs in standard JSON Resume format from other tools
  - Ability to export CVs in standard JSON Resume format for use in other services

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Development Principles

- **Code Standards**:

  - Naming conventions:
    - PascalCase for components, interfaces and types
    - camelCase for variables, functions and properties
    - UPPER_CASE for constants
    - kebab-case for files and folders (except Vue components)
  - Biome for code quality and formatting
  - Systematic use of TypeScript types
  - JSDoc documentation for public APIs
  - Preferred immutability
  - Composition API for Vue components

- **Internationalization**:

  - Centralization of translation keys in @cv-generator/shared
  - Separation of messages by functional domain (ui, validation, etc.)
  - Use of the Adapter pattern to isolate the domain from the Vue I18n implementation
  - Support for pluralization and variables in messages
  - Automatic detection of browser language
  - Saving user language preference

- **Testing Strategy**:

  - Unit tests with Vitest for business logic (@cv-generator/core)
  - Component tests for the UI with Testing Library (@cv-generator/ui)
  - E2E tests for complete user flows with Playwright
  - Automatic validation of JSON Resume format in tests
  - Minimum coverage: 80% for core, 70% for UI
  - Translation tests to verify completeness and consistency

- **Collaboration Model**:

  - GitHub Flow (branching model)
  - Pull Requests with at least one approver
  - Continuous integration (CI/CD)
  - Conventional commits (enforced via Husky)
  - Systematic code review

- **Documentation**:
  - Complete README with installation guide and usage
  - Architecture documentation (Clean Architecture)
  - Documentation of data structures according to the JSON Resume standard
  - JSDoc for public APIs
  - Automatically maintained changelog
  - Internationalization guide for new developers

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Risks and Mitigations

- **Technical Risks**:

  1. **localStorage Limitations**:

     - Risk: Limited storage capacity for large CVs
     - Mitigation: Data compression, JSON export for external backup

  2. **PDF Export Performance**:

     - Risk: Potentially slow PDF generation time on weak devices
     - Mitigation: Rendering optimization, visual feedback, asynchronous generation

  3. **Browser Compatibility**:

     - Risk: Feature divergence between browsers
     - Mitigation: Cross-browser testing, polyfills, feature detection

  4. **JSON Resume Standard Evolution**:

     - Risk: The standard could evolve and require adaptations
     - Mitigation: Modular architecture allowing easy updates, data migration system

  5. **Offline Experience**:

     - Risk: Limited functionality in offline mode
     - Mitigation: PWA architecture, intelligent synchronization, explicit offline mode

  6. **Monorepo Complexity**:

     - Risk: Complex dependency management and integration
     - Mitigation: Automation scripts, robust CI/CD, clear documentation

  7. **Translation Consistency**:

     - Risk: Inconsistency of messages between layers and incomplete translations
     - Mitigation: Centralization of keys, automatic validation of translation completeness, dedicated tests

  8. **Clean Architecture Principles Violation with i18n**:
     - Risk: The domain could become dependent on the Vue I18n framework
     - Mitigation: Use of the Adapter pattern, abstract port interface in the domain

- **Mitigation Strategies**:

  - Extensive automated tests
  - Performance monitoring
  - Early detection of incompatibilities
  - Regular monitoring of JSON Resume standard evolution
  - Proactive user feedback
  - Complete architecture and development documentation
  - Automatic checking of translation consistency

- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Architecture with lightweight backend (rejected to favor simplicity and offline operation)
  - Use of IndexedDB database (kept as a future option if localStorage becomes limiting)
  - React framework (Vue.js preferred for its simplicity and Composition API)
  - Proprietary CV format (rejected in favor of the open JSON Resume standard)
  - Multirepo structure (rejected in favor of monorepo for consistency and ease of development)
  - i18next library (rejected in favor of Vue I18n for better Vue.js integration)
